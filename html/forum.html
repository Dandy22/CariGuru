        <p>
          As someone who comes from a non-computer science background, I understand the doubts that can come with making
          a career switch. However, I'm excited to share my personal experience of successfully transitioning into the
          tech industry, particularly within the fintech sector.
          Over the past five years, I have gained valuable experience working in a variety of environments, from small
          and agile teams to large-scale projects that serve millions of users. Through these experiences, I've gained a
          deep understanding of the industry and the skills required to succeed in it.
          I am passionate about sharing my knowledge and experiences with others.

              <p>Edric was a fantastic mentor for my software engineering journey. His guidance helped me see the path
                to becoming a more successful engineer. He has a lot of knowledge and did a great job of breaking it
                down into practical steps, and made it clear what I needed to focus on. I really liked how Edric
                adjusted his approach based on my abilities. As we went on during the mentorship, we’d identify other
                areas of skills that I’d need to work on and Edric would always be quick to come up with a plan of how
                to best tackle that and keep in line with our overall development plan at the same time. He was always
                there to answer my questions in good time, no matter how simple or complex, helping overcome any
                hurdles. I'm so grateful for Edric’s help and I know he’d be great for anyone that’s considering him, at
                any level of their career.
